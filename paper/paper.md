# Abstract

# Introduction

The intersection of artificial intelligence and conversational data presents a compelling frontier for research, particularly when exploring specialized fields such as biology and health sciences. The WildChat dataset, with its vast collection of over one million user-chatbot interactions, provides an unparalleled resource for examining how advanced language models engage with a diverse array of topics. Capturing dialogues generated by models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, WildChat not only offers a glimpse into everyday conversational dynamics but also holds potential for specialized inquiries.

Understanding how AI handles bioinformatics and health-related conversations is crucial for advancing both AI technology and domain-specific applications. The ability of conversational models to process and respond to complex biological queries can significantly impact research, education, and practical applications in health sciences. By delving into WildChat's dataset, we aim to uncover how these models interpret and manage discussions centered around biology and health, highlighting their effectiveness and areas for improvement.

Our study is driven by the objective to identify and analyze bioinformatics-related interactions within the dataset. Through a focused filtering process and subsequent evaluation using advanced tools, we explore how well these conversations are represented and how different models perform in handling them. This investigation not only sheds light on the capabilities of current conversational AI systems but also provides insights into their potential role in supporting and advancing biological and health science research.

# Related Work

The integration of conversational datasets into bioinformatics research is a burgeoning field with notable advancements and applications. One significant example is the SciQ dataset, a specialized resource that pairs scientific questions with answers, intended to enhance machine comprehension of scientific texts. SciQ exemplifies how conversational and question-answering datasets can be leveraged to improve the interpretability and utility of bioinformatics tools. By focusing on domain-specific queries, SciQ aids in training models to handle complex scientific language and context, which is crucial for bioinformatics applications.

In addition to SciQ, other research has explored the use of conversational datasets for improving scientific literature search and information retrieval. For instance, models trained on general conversational data have been adapted to support scientific inquiry by fine-tuning them on domain-specific corpora. This approach has shown promise in creating more effective tools for extracting and synthesizing information from large volumes of scientific texts.

However, these approaches face several limitations. Many models, while adept at general language understanding, struggle with the specialized vocabulary and context inherent in bioinformatics. Additionally, the existing datasets often lack the depth required for handling nuanced biological queries, which can limit the effectiveness of the models in real-world applications.

By addressing these limitations and expanding the scope of conversational datasets, researchers can develop more robust and context-aware bioinformatics tools. Exploring how conversational data can enhance model performance in handling biological questions offers a promising direction for future research and development in this field.
